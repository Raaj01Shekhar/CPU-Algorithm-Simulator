# CPU-Algorithm-Simulator
CPU scheduling stands as a pivotal facet within operating systems, ensuring the optimal utilization of the processor's capabilities. In a multi-process environment, diverse scheduling algorithms come into play to allocate CPU time across distinct processes. A CPU scheduling simulator emerges as a potent tool for comprehending the intricacies of varied scheduling algorithms and their ramifications on overall system performance.

Within this undertaking, we have crafted a CPU scheduling simulator, leveraging the Swing GUI framework in the Java programming language. This simulator encompasses the realization of six distinct scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling, and Preemptive Priority Scheduling. Users hold the capability to emulate these algorithms, specifying pivotal parameters such as arrival time, burst time, and process priority.

The primary objective of this endeavor resides in delivering a visual portrayal elucidating the mechanics underpinning diverse CPU scheduling algorithms, alongside their discernible impacts on overall system performance. Capitalizing on a graphical user interface, users gain the ability to interactively formulate and execute simulations, thereby witnessing real-time outcomes. Moreover, a core emphasis has been placed on crafting an interface that is intuitive and facile to comprehend, rendering this project a cherished resource for both students and professionals aspiring to deepen their grasp of CPU scheduling algorithms.
